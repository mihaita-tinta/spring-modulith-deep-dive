[[module-design.module-api-defaults]]
== 📖 Fundamentals of Application Module design

- Application module's base package considered its API package.
- Any nested package is considered module-internal. Code residing in it is not allowed to be accessed by other application modules.

[[module-design.control-visibility]]
== 🧑‍💻 Using Application Modules to control visibility

[[module-design.control-visibility.objectives]]
=== 🎯 Objectives

You'll learn how to…

* … add components and events to the module and control their visibility
* … verify foreign application modules cannot access internal components

[[module-design.control-visibility.package-protected-types]]
=== 👣 Hiding application module internals by using the package scope

1. Add an `OrderRepository` class in default scope to the `order` package
+
[source, java]
----
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
class OrderRepository {}
----

2. Create a Spring bean reference to the `OrderRepository` in `OrderManagement`.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{source}/order/OrderManagement.java[tags=class]
----

3. Re-run `ApplicationModularityTests` and see how the output shows that `OrderRepository` is detected as internal module component (the `o` in front of the type name).
+
[source]
----
…
# Order
> Logical name: order
> Base package: com.example.app.order
> Direct module dependencies: none
> Spring beans:
  + ….OrderManagement
  o ….OrderRepository
----
4. Try to add a reference to `OrderRepository` from `ApplicationModularityTests` and see how the compiler prevents that.

[[module-design.control-visibility.nested-packages]]
=== 👣 Hiding components in nested packages
1. Introduce a package named `order.persistence` and move `OrderRepository` to that package.
To resolve the compiler error this creates in `OrderManagement`, change the visibility of the repository type to `public`.
2. Re-run `ApplicationModularityTests` and see how the output shows that `OrderRepository` is still considered an internal component (the leading `o` in front of it) as it does not reside in the API package.
+
[source]
----
…
# Order
> Logical name: order
> Base package: com.example.app.order
> Direct module dependencies: none
> Spring beans:
  + ….OrderManagement
  o ….persistence.OrderRepository
----

[[module-design.control-visibility.named-interfaces]]
=== 👣 Steps -- Named interfaces

- Annotate package with `@NamedInterface`
- Discuss output
- Add type in root package, annotated -> also assigned to that NI
////

[[module-design.relationships]]
== 🧑‍💻 Establishing relationships between modules

[[module-design.relationships.objectives]]
=== 🎯 Objectives

You'll learn how to…

* … establish relationships between modules via Spring bean references
* … detect invalid dependencies via a JUnit-based architectural fitness function

[[module-design.relationships.managing-type-relationships]]
=== 👣 Managing type relationships

- Introduce inventory
- Create `Inventory`
- Add constructor argument of type `OrderManagement`
- add verify()
- Run test -> green
- Change constructor argument to `OrderRepository` -> red as it's an internal component
