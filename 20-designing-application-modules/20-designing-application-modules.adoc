[[module-design.control-visibility]]
== 🧑‍💻 -- Using Application Modules to control visibility

[[module-design.control-visibility.objectives]]
=== 🎯 Objectives

You'll learn how to…

* … add components and events to the module and control their visibility
* … verify foreign application modules cannot access internal components

[[module-design.control-visibility.hiding-components]]
=== 👣 Steps -- Hiding components in nested packages

[[module-design.control-visibility.named-interfaces]]
=== 👣 Steps -- Named interfaces

- Annotate package with `@NamedInterface`
- Discuss output
- Add type in root package, annotated -> also assigned to that NI

[[module-design.relationships]]
== 🧑‍💻 - Establishing relationships between modules

[[module-design.relationships.objectives]]
=== 🎯 Objectives

You'll learn how to…

* … establish relationships between modules via Spring bean references
* … detect invalid dependencies via a JUnit-based fitness function

[[module-design.relationships.managing-type-relationships]]
=== 👣 Steps -- Managing type relationships

- Introduce inventory
- Create `InventoryManagement`
- Add constructor argument of type `OrderManagement`
- add verify()
- Run test -> green
- Change constructor argument to `OrderRepository` -> red as it's an internal component
